### 🎨 Frontend Development with Tailwind CSS, HTML, and TypeScript

* UI should be implemented using **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
* Markup must be structured with **semantic HTML5** elements.
* Interactive or dynamic behavior should be implemented in **TypeScript**.

* Structure components to be **modular, reusable, and scalable**.
* Use **Alpine.js** or similar lightweight tools if needed (when not using Vue/React).
* Ensure **UI consistency** across all screens and states (loading, error, empty, etc.).
* Follow **utility-first CSS principles** provided by Tailwind CSS.
* Keep front-end codebase **clean, typed, and maintainable**.
